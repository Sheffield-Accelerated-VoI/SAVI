### What SAVI does

Using only PSA results from your model

In a matter of seconds from the SAVI online application you can generate:

* Standardised assessment of uncertainty (C-E planes and CEACs)
* Overall EVPI per patient, per jurisdiction per year and over your decision relevance horizon
* Expected Value of Perfect Parameter Information (EVPPI) for single and groups of parameters

The online application is hosted at https://savi.shef.ac.uk/SAVI/
